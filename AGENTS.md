# Repository Guidelines

## Authoritative Repository

The canonical source for this plugin is maintained at https://github.com/realityforge/RuleRanger. Please open pull
requests and issues on that repository.

This plugin is sometimes integrated into other repositories via git subtree merge or distributed as a direct download (
unzip into `Plugins/RuleRanger/`). Those copies are mirrors for consumption; treat them as downstream integrations and
avoid filing issues/PRs there.

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `RuleRanger.uplugin` declares modules; each module sits under `Source/<Module>/Public` and `Source/<Module>/Private`
  so shared headers stay isolated from implementation-only details. There exists a single `RuleRanger` module at this time.
- The `RuleRanger` module is broken down into the:
  - Rule Ranger Core: `Source/RuleRanger/Public/*`, `Source/RuleRanger/Public/RuleRanger/*`, `Source/RuleRanger/Private/*`, `Source/RuleRanger/Private/RuleRanger/*`
  - Separate matcher and action classes defined as a header and implementation pair present in `Source/RuleRanger/Private/RuleRanger/*` subdirectories.
- Raw files (such as `.csv` files) from which Unreal assets are imported belong in `SourceContent`, while `Content` is
reserved for runtime assets that ship with the plugin.
- Generated binaries and build artifacts should stay out of version control and should stay untouched unless you are
  troubleshooting a local build.
- Keep `README.md` aligned with new features so downstream teams stay informed.

## Tooling & Engine Version

- Target Unreal Engine 5.6 for both development and verification; earlier engine releases are unsupported.

## General Principles

- Readability: Write code that is easy to read and understand. Prioritize clarity over overly clever or obscure
  solutions.
- Consistency: Strive for consistency in naming, formatting, and architectural patterns throughout the project.
- Simplicity (KISS): Keep It Simple, Stupid. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY): Avoid code duplication. Utilize functions, classes, and reusable components.
- Commenting:
    - Comment code that is complex, non-obvious, or critical.
    - Explain why something is done, not just what is being done (if the what is clear from the code).
    - Keep comments up-to-date with code changes.
- Modularity: Design components to be as self-contained and reusable as possible.
- Performance: Be mindful of performance implications, especially for real-time operations. Profile and optimize
  critical code paths.
- Error Handling: Implement robust error handling and provide clear feedback to users or logs when errors occur.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Follow Unreal Engine defaults: 4-space indentation, PascalCase types, Functions and Variables, `F[StructName]` for
  structs, `U[ClassName]` for UObject classes, and `E[EnumName]` for enums, `b[BooleanVariable]`.
- Use type deduction (for example, `auto`) when it keeps intent clear and remains within Unreal Engine 5.6â€™s supported
  C++ feature set.
- Place new public headers under `Source/<Module>/Public/<Module>/` and implementation files under the matching
  `Private` path.
- Prefer UE logging macros with the `LogRuleRanger` category; declare new categories in module `Private` headers when
  needed.
- Keep includes ordered and minimal; prefer forward declarations in headers. Use #pragma once for include guards.
- Use Doxygen-style comments for documenting classes, functions, and significant variables for API documentation
  generation.
- Match existing code style when not covered by the above rules.

## Testing Guidelines

- Automation coverage is aspirational. Capture edge cases in unit-style specs once a testing harness lands under
  `Source/<Module>/Private/Tests/`.
- Until formal suites exist, document manual reproduction steps or sample maps in the pull request so reviewers can
  exercise the change.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Write imperative, present-tense commit messages under 72 characters.
- Squash noisy work-in-progress commits locally; each change should stand on its own.
- Open pull requests with a clear summary, reproduction or test notes, and screenshots or GIFs when changes impact
  in-editor UX.
